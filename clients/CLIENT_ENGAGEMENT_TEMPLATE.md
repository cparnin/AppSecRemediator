# Enterprise Security Auto-Remediation Service

Transforms vulnerability backlogs from weeks of manual work into minutes of automated fixes.

## 30-Second Pitch
**Problem**: Your security team finds vulnerabilities faster than developers can fix them.
**Solution**: AI-powered scanner that finds issues AND creates GitHub PRs with fixes.
**Result**: 80% faster remediation with detailed explanations for your team.

## What We Deliver

### Security Scanning

- **Exposed secrets**: API keys, passwords, tokens
- **Vulnerable dependencies**: CVEs with specific fix versions
- **Cross-file analysis**: Attack chains across multiple files
- **SBOM compliance**: Automatic software bill of materials generation

### AI Auto-Remediation
- **Code fixes**: Specific changes with line numbers
- **Dependency updates**: Version bumps to secure releases  
- **Business context**: Why each vulnerability matters
- **Separate PRs**: Code fixes vs dependency updates
- **Compliance reporting**: CycloneDX and SPDX formats for supply chain visibility

### Works With Any Stack
